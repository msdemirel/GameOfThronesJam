# GameOfThronesJam
"Throne Gems" is a hyper casual game that was created for the Game of Thrones Jam, a thrilling game development competition inspired by the popular fantasy series. In this addictive game, players embark on a gem-collecting adventure by strategically throwing birds towards shimmering gems. The objective is to skillfully navigate through challenging levels and gather as many precious gems as possible.

Although "Throne Gems" did not secure any prizes in the competition, the journey of developing this game was an invaluable experience for me as a game developer. Throughout the development process, I honed my skills in game design, level balancing, and creating engaging gameplay mechanics.
